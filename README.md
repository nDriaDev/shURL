## Try demo locally

shURL requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to run locally.

I used pnpm as package manager, so if you don't have it, you will need to change the run scripts in the package.json of the be and fe folders.

Steps:
- Install the dependencies in _be_ and _fe_ directory.
- go into be folder.
- create public/private key for refresh token and access token.
- generate base64 from keys.
- create in your mongodb local a collection with name _URL_SHORTNER_
- create a table _URL_ and _USER_
- setting an email provider, otherwise sign in not working
- create a .env.dev file in config dir at root project, with these options
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
MONGO_DB_URI=<your uri>
DB=URL_SHORTNER
TABLE_URL=URL
TABLE_USER=USER
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<base64 access token secret>
REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY_PRIVATE=<base64 refresh token private key>
REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY_PUBLIC=<base64 refresh token public key>
MAIL_EMAIL_SENDER=
MAIL_CLIENT_ID=
MAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=
MAIL_OAUTH_URL=
MAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=
```
- Run project
```sh
pnpm run start
```
- open http://localhost:3000
